# Koadic
Koadic, or COM Command & Control, is a Windows post-exploitation rootkit similar to other penetration testing tools such as Meterpreter and Powershell Empire. The major difference is that Koadic does most of its operations using Windows Script Host (a.k.a. JScript/VBScript), with compatibility in the core to support a default installation of Windows 2000 with no service packs (and potentially even versions of NT4) all the way through Windows 10.

It is possible to serve payloads completely in memory from stage 0 to beyond, as well as use cryptographically secure communications over SSL and TLS (depending on what the victim OS has enabled).

Koadic also attempts to be compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.

### Install

```
# git clone https://github.com/zerosum0x0/koadic.git
# cd koadic
# pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Demo

[![Koadic Demo](http://img.youtube.com/vi/EmUxTqS5GrA/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmUxTqS5GrA "Koadic Demo")

1. Hooks a zombie
2. Elevates integrity (UAC Bypass)
3. Dumps SAM/SECURITY hive for passwords
4. Scans local network for open SMB
5. Pivots to another machine

### Stagers
Stagers hook target zombies and allow you to use implants.

Module | Description
--------|------------
stager/js/mshta | serves payloads in memory using MSHTA.exe HTML Applications
stager/js/regsvr | serves payloads in memory using regsvr32.exe COM+ scriptlets
stager/js/rundll32_js | serves payloads in memory using rundll32.exe
stager/js/disk | serves payloads using files on disk
stager/js/wmic | serves payloads in memory using WMIC
stager/js/bitsadmin | transfers a .wsf payload containing JScript over a Bitsadmin job and executes it

### Future Improvements (a.k.a. Koadic 2.0)
- Rewrite and redesign the server stack to be cleaner.
- Actual VBScript support.
